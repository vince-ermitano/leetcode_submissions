# Notes

## Idea
* Longest path must be between any two leaf nodes.
* Longest path is where a node maximizes the sum of its left branch's height and its right branch's height.

## Complexity
* Time complexity is *O(N)* to traverse through the nodes.
* Space complexity is *O(N)* for the recursive dfs function to traverse through the nodes.
