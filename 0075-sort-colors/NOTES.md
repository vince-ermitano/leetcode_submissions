# Notes

## Idea
* Dutch National Flag Problem
* Traverse through list while keeping track of the right boundaries for the 0s and left boundaries for the 1s
* When we encounter a 0 or a 2, swap it will the corresponding boundary to start collecting the right colors to their appropriate positions

## Complexity
* Time complexity is *O(N)*
* Space complexity is *O(1)*
