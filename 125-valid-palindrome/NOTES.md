# Notes

## Idea/Approach
* Use two pointers to check if each pairing of characters matches.
* Can reverse the string to see if the reversed and non-reversed strings match

## Complexity
* Time complexity is *O(N)* because we only need to pass through the string once
* Space complexity is *O(1)* because we only need to keep track of two pointers.
