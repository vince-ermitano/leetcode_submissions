# Notes

## Idea
* Dynamic programming
* At each element i, you can determine the max sum of contiguous elements that comes before i and include i.
* Return highest sum seen during the traversal

## Complexity
* Time complexity is *O(N)*
* Space complexity is *O(1)*

### Extra
* Think about how to solve with divide and conquer.
