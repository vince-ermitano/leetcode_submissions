# Notes

## Idea
* For every pairing of characters, we can increase the palindrome length by 2.
* There is an edge case to put a unique character in the middle of a even length string to increase the length of the palindrome by 1.

## Complexity
* Time complexity is *O(N)* to iterate through the string and the values of the hashmap.
* Space complexity is *O(N)* to store the counts of the unique characters in the string.
